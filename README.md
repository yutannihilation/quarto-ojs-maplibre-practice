An attempt to share data between R and Observable JS on a Quarto document.

* [Hello MapLibre / Nicolas Lambert | Observable](https://observablehq.com/@neocartocnrs/hello-maplibre)
* [【初級編】MapLibre GL JSを使ったWebGIS作成](https://zenn.dev/asahina820/books/c29592e397a35b)

Some findings:

* It works.
* It's not obvious how to include a data that cannot be embedded in the document. In this repository, a PNG file and a GeoJSON file is used, but these needed to be manually added in GitHub Pages.
